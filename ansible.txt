Ansible:
	is an open-source IT automation tool development to configure multiple system, deploy software and orchestrate more advance IT task.
	Written in YAML(Yet another Markup language).
	
Installation of machanies:
	VM Name with IP:
	ansible-c (controller)(192.168.99.1/24)
	mhost1	(node1)(192.168.99.10/24)
	mhost2	(node2)(192.168.99.20/24)
	mhost3	(node3)(192.168.99.30/24)
	mhost4	(node4)(192.168.99.40/24)

Step1: Install the machines as per the above requirement.
Step2: Hard disk, network: Internal network; name:ansible
Step3: In ansible-c controller node go to vim /etc/hosts and enter entry of other nodes like below;
	192.168.99.10	mhost1.example.com	mhost1
	192.168.99.20	mhost2.example.com	mhost2
	192.168.99.30	mhost3.example.com	mhost3
	192.168.99.40	mhost4.example.com	mhost4

Step4: Ping all the nodes from Controller machine.
Step5: In ansible-c:
	dnf repolist = to display available repo
	dnf install epel-release



ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION FILE:

export ANSIBLE_CONFIG=/tmp/ansible.cfg = will change the ansible config file to this location
ansible --version = here you can see the changed config file path
touch ansible.cfg = create this two files in home directory
touch .ansible.cfg	
unset ANSIBLE_CONFIG = to unset the config file path
ansible --version = you can see the changed config file path
rm ansible.cfg = so when you delete one of the file and check the verison you can see the different config file path

ansible.config file:
	[Defaults]
	inventory file = /etc/ansible/hosts
	forks = 5 (means ansible can start 5 parallel connections to the nodes, 5 connection simultaneously)
	remote_port = 22 (ssh port, by default ansible have ssh port)
	
	-plays will gather facts by default, which contain info about the remote system.
		smart = gather by default, but dont regather if already gathered.
		implicit = gather by default, can turn off with gather_facts: False
		explicit = do not gather by default, must say gather_facts: True
